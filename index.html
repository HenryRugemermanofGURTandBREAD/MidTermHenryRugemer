	<h1>Cause and Effect Model</h1>

  	<p>
    This model shows the cause and affects of poaching. Most poacher's don't like their job and have no choice because they are poor. The only reason they poach is for
money and a better life. There is a high demand for special horns and certain types of fur which leads to those animals getting hunted and puts their species in 
danger of existence.

<h1>Story Board</h1>

  	<p>
This story board was just a first draft. This was just the initial idea of how the story would go when filming we ended up adding some scenes and deleting some 
scenes we just had this as a guide. For example in the story board the poacher kills himself but when filiming we decided that wasn't school appropriate so we
made some adjustments.

<h1>Characters and Set</h1>

  	<p>
When we started to form the characters with clay we needed some source of inspiration. We knew that we wanted two humans, a rihno, a snake, some backround details
like the trees and the table and bed. To get inspiration for these creation we googled some images of claymation characters and based our characters off of that.

The images above are the characters and set design that we used in the movie. We made all of these with our own hands with clay and cardboard in class.

<h1>Code and Technology</h1>

    When you clap the pew pew sound plays and in the backround there is always this melody playing "G D F E D E C5 " forever.
